## ➕ Adding New Presentations

### Method 1: Using the Helper Script (Recommended)

1. Create a new folder for your presentation
2. Add your `index.html` and other files
3. Run the helper script:
   ```bash
   node add-presentation.js "Presentation Name" "Description" "folder-name"
   ```

### Method 2: Manual Addition

1. Create your presentation folder with all necessary files
2. Edit `index.html` and add a new card above the template comment
3. Follow the existing card structure

## 🎨 Customization

- **Main page styling**: Edit the CSS in `index.html`
- **Presentation themes**: Each presentation can have its own CSS files
- **Reveal.js options**: Configure in each presentation's `index.html`

## 🌐 Deployment

The site is configured for easy deployment on Netlify. See `DEPLOYMENT.md` for complete instructions.

### Quick Deploy
1. Drag your entire workspace folder to Netlify
2. Your site will be live instantly
3. The main index page will be your homepage

## 🔧 Requirements

- Each presentation folder needs its own `index.html`
- Presentations should use relative paths for assets
- The main `index.html` serves as the landing page

## 📱 Features

- **Responsive design**: Works on all devices
- **Modern UI**: Clean, professional appearance
- **Easy navigation**: One-click access to all presentations
- **Auto-updating**: Helper script keeps the index current
- **Netlify ready**: Optimized for static hosting
